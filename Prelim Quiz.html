      <h1>My Favorite Place</h1>
        <h2>Baguio City</h2>
        <p>Baguio was discovered way back in 1572 by Juan Salcedo. <br> It was established as a hill station in 1900 at Ibaloy Village known as Kafagway.<br> In 1903, an American architect named Daniel Hudson Burnham had an idea to turn it into a city.</p>
        
        <p>Baguio became my favorite place since when I was 6 because I used to make the <br> best memories of my life there. Living there used to be my dream; <br> unfortunately, my mom didn't allow me to live and study there alone. <br> However, it is still a privilege for me to go back there every summer or <br> between the months of January and February. Baguio will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
