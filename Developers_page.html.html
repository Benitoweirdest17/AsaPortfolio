        <div class="bio-text">
            <p>Hi I am Benito Hosea Q. Asa 2nd year from University of the East Manila taking BSCS. <br> Growing up, I was always intrigued by how things work, especially computers and software. <br> This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I have been able <br> to explore various areas such as programming, algorithms, and software engineering. <br> I am planning to be a software or a cloud engineer in the future. <br> <br> I am fascinated with different things such as AI, web development, <br> cloud computing, and cybersecurity. The way AI is transforming industries, the ever-evolving nature of <br> cybersecurity, and the power of cloud-based solutions inspire me to continue learning and improving my skills. <br> Beyond academics, I enjoy working on personal projects to apply what I’ve learned, whether <br> it's building web applications, experimenting with AI models, or setting up cloud environments. <br> I believe that hands-on experience is the best way to grow as a developer.</p>
